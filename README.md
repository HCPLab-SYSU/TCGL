## Abstract
Attempt to fully discover the temporal diversity and global-local chronological characteristics for self-supervised video representation learning, this work takes advantage of the temporal structure of videos and further proposes a novel self-supervised method named Temporal Contrastive Graph (TCG). In contrast to the existing methods that randomly shuffle the video frames or video snippets within a video, the TCG roots in a hybrid graph contrastive learning strategy to regard the inter-snippet and intra-snippet temporal relationships as self-supervision signals for temporal representation learning. To increase the temporal diversity of features, the TCG integrates the prior knowledge about the frame and snippet orders into temporal contrastive graphs, i.e., the intra-/inter- snippet temporal contrastive graph modules. By randomly removing edges and masking node features of the intra-snippet graphs or inter-snippet graphs, the TCG can generate different correlated graph views. Then, specific contrastive losses are designed to maximize the agreement between node embeddings in different views. To learn the global context representation and recalibrate the channel-wise features adaptively, we introduce an adaptive video snippet order prediction module, which leverages the relational knowledge among video snippets to predict the actual snippet orders. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TCG over the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval benchmarks.
